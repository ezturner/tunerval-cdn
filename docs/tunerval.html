		<h1>Tunerval - Learn to hear musical intervals in your head</h1>
		<p>The fastest way to learn relative pitch.</p>

		<h3>Table of Contents</h2>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Tunerval simultaneously helps you with three musical skills related to ear training: audiation, relative pitch, and intonation. <br><br>

				â€¢ Audiation is the ability to hear a pitch in your head <br>
				â€¢ Relative pitch is the ability to identify or produce an interval from a reference pitch <br>
				â€¢ Intonation is the ability to discriminate pitches which are close together <br>
			</p>

			<h2>How to play</h2>
			<p>
			Tunerval plays two pitches. For the specified interval, you must use your ear to determine whether the second pitch played was sharp, flat, or spot on. As you get more questions correct, the difference between the correct interval and the sharp and flat pitches decreases.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			<b style="font-size: 130%; text-decoration: underline;"><i>If you want to continue to improve, you need to project the pitch of the correct interval in your head and compare it with the pitch that was played.</b></i>
			</p>

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>What is Â±100c?</h3>
			<p>As you continue to answer questions correctly, the difference between the correct interval and the sharp and flat pitches decreases. This is a measure of how close you are to the correct interval.</p>

			<p>The distance you are from the correct interval is expressed in <i>cents</i> (shorthand is the 'c'). There are 100 cents between any two adjacent notes. So, there are 100 cents between C and C#, and 200 cents between C# and D#.</p>

			<h3>How can I hear the correct interval?</h3>
			<p>
				After you get an answer wrong, you can click on each of the shap, flat, or in tune buttons to hear what each would of sounded like. 
			</p>

			<h3>I'm not making progresss. Help!</h3>
			<p>
				Try adjusting the settings so that the game easier. The following would be considered very easy settings.
				<ul>
					<li>Note range: C5-C5</li>
					<li>Intervals: Perfect Fifth</li>
					<li>Note duration: 0.65s</li>
					<li>Note duration variation: 0.0s</li>
				</ul>

				Once you can do better than Â±35c, add another interval into the mix. Continue adding intervals until you have all ascending and descending intervals below Â±35c. Then, repeat this process but expand the note range to C4-C5.
